## quite simply, some things :tanabata_tree:
#### 'cause you know, I am the M0nkey King
<br>🖰 prolly figured out who I am already since you're here
<br>🖰 here and there, either busy doin' work, tryin' stuff out, or just m0nkeying
<br>🖰 think for yourself; don't just blindly accept something
<br>🖰 don't waste time [at least, for the most part (try not to)] :kissing_heart:
<br>🖰 those with the most ridiculous ideologies tend to be so sure of themselves (and try very hard to back themselves up); beware
<br>🖰 bend with the wind
<br>🖰 yoinkers, coding's sure's somethin'

<br> as one who lives to eat, here're some things me like to munch on :trollface:
<br> croissants ![](images/croissant.png)
<br> oolong tea ![](images/oolong_tea.png)
<br> spicy stuff ![](images/hot_pepper.png)
